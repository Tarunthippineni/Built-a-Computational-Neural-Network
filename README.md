# Computational Neural Network for Image Recognition

## Project Overview
This project involves building a computational neural network (CNN) designed for image recognition. The aim is to accurately classify and identify images using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Implementation of a CNN model for image recognition
- Preprocessing and augmentation of image data
- Training and validation of the model on a dataset
- Evaluation of the model's performance
- Visualization of training results and predictions

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Place your training images in the `data/train` directory
    - Place your validation images in the `data/validation` directory

2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

4. Make predictions on new images:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
    ```

## Results
- Accuracy: XX%
- Loss: XX
- Examples of correctly classified images:
    - ![Example Image](path/to/example1.jpg)
    - ![Example Image](path/to/example2.jpg)
- Confusion matrix and other performance metrics can be found in the `results` directory.
